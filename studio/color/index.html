    <h1>Color Exercise </h1>
    <p>The color I chose for the biggest square is the 2017 pantone clor, called greenery.
    The second and third squares are the analogous color of the greenery. The hover background color
    is the complementary color of the hue. So, in this way, the three hove effect colors are analogous color as well.
    The opacity of the squares are 0.8, which able to see how colors interact with other when they overlaped together.
    The opposition shows the falling down movement of the square.</p>
