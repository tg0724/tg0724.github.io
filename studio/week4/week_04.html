    <center><h1>Information is Important</h1></center>
    <br>
      <p>My word for the theme is "information".
      The first interpretation is that design should be informational.
      I think that a successful design should satisfy the aesthetic and function requirements
      at the same time. Due to the fast grow of the world, especially the people in the cities, e
      fficiency is one of the significant things being cared about. In the past, people may would
       like to read 1000 words to know what is happening world, but now people are more like to
       read short news, infographics, pictures or even bullet point outlines to know what is
       happening because they care about time consuming. So, how to make a website(only talk
       about web and app for now) that can make people know the information at the first glance
       is also important. After some researches, I found that the clear hierarchy, appropriate
       fonts, structured layout and well-chosen pictures can all contribute to improve user's
       experience. From design perspective, as a designer, I always like to add some decoration
       based on my personal will. But for a website, it is more user based. Too much decorative
       element or animations might overwhelm the users and take the place of the real information
       that should e delivered to users.  In this way, every element that appear on the website
       should has its own reason.

       <br><br>The second step is design "information". Not only for the elements showed on the website,
       the information on the webpage should also be designed. I think designer should be able to deal
       with huge information and convert the dry data to a vivid design. No one would like to read dry
       numbers, codes. A way to do it to transform the date to infographic, tables, pictures, video, i
       nteractive apps and so on. Then I look more to information design, which is similar to data
       visualization. We are live in a big data world. Big data is a new concept. What can big data
       do is that it concludes the history data, get a conclusion and estimate the future. There are
       three kinds of data for now but none of them belongs to art area. In my personal opinion, I do
       no think that big data will influence the art itself but will definitely useful to estimate the
       value of the art. What another thing it can do is that it enable designers to get a better
       understanding of users preference based on the data analysis, which is super helpful for
       interaction design--an area deign based on human.

       <br><br>Just for now, I think I will focus on how to design information, how to transfer the data, information to designs and how to make it interactive with users. But I will definitely dig more into the algorithms and big data in art area more.

      <br><br>Here are the two examples. I did not choose the projects made by professional institution, instead that I found more projects made by students in Columbia University and Northeastern University. The first one is the more like infographics that analysis the conflict in Colombia . The second one is more users based interactive website about the color and New York street view.
