  <h1> Theme Blog 1</h1>

  <p>My theme is information. Information is such a huge
    taking that contains lots of aspects. And I am specifically
    interested in data visualization. In my opinion, data
    visualization is such a good way to present tons of data
    in a efficient way. Instead of reading 10 pages long text,
    an vivid lively infographic can represent everything. So, my
    thought is to combine the form of interactive website and
    infographic together, which means that an animated infographics.

    Also, there are various kinds of data and I am interesting the
    education issue in poverty area. No matter in developing, undeveloped
    or even developed countries, there many families cannot afford their kids
    for education. At the same time, there might even no education sources
    available. For example, school in poverty area are rely to the volunteer
    who wish to teach the kids. However, those volunteers are temporary
    teacher and only few of them decide to stay there. So, what I want
    is gathering this data and make a website for those kids so that more
    people can know what is happening in the world while they are enjoying
    their life. If everyone can help a bite, then I believe the issue will
    become much better. I want to let people know how serious is this
    issue and how we can contribute to help.

    I dig deeper to the issue that I chose and I knew how serious this issue is. Based on the statistic, the lack of education can cause a series problem. So, I change my idea a little bit. I want to design something that could help those kid to learn knowledge even without the real teachers in life. The only question that I have is that I knew it is hard for them to access the internet, so how can they see my website? No matter what, I still want to focus on give the basic education to kids to help them. The design needs to be informational too. Children are really easy to accept new stuff. So, I want to set up different levels of the courses. Also, because it is really hard for children concentrate for a long time. What I want is to make the interface very interesting and interactive so they might enjoy the learning process. Also, the lay out and the color combinations should all be different from the commercial website.

In this way, design for children who are difficult to get basic education is my goal. I looked up some website of this area but many of them are build on commercial website,  which is not what I want. In this website, all the games and courses are free. And from the design area, I think I will take children books as references. My next step is to explore more what are the best appropriate way to design for kids and at same time also convey the knowledges.
