  <p>My theme is information. Information is such a huge
    taking that contains lots of aspects. And I am specifically
    interested in data visualization. In my opinion, data
    visualization is such a good way to present tons of data
    in a efficient way. Instead of reading 10 pages long text,
    an vivid lively infographic can represent everything. So, my
    thought is to combine the form of interactive website and
    infographic together, which means that an animated infographics.

    Also, there are various kinds of data and I am interesting the
    education issue in poverty area. No matter in developing, undeveloped
    or even developed countries, there many families cannot afford their kids
    for education. At the same time, there might even no education sources
    available. For example, school in poverty area are rely to the volunteer
    who wish to teach the kids. However, those volunteers are temporary
    teacher and only few of them decide to stay there. So, what I want
    is gathering this data and make a website for those kids so that more
    people can know what is happening in the world while they are enjoying
    their life. If everyone can help a bite, then I believe the issue will
    become much better. I want to let people know how serious is this
    issue and how we can contribute to help.
