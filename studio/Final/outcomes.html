        For the achievement of study, it will mainly be divided into two
        parts to discuss. The first is knowledge, the second is knowledge.
        I had heard a speech made by volunteer who comes from Africa, Although
        they do not have good conditions to see the outside world, it does not
        mean they  do not have right to see. Living in areas where resources are
        scarce, they  think they are happy because they do not know what the
        outside world is like, thus can make a comparison. But it they have this
        website, they can see animation, games and all kinds of knowledge, which
        will inspire their motivation to learn, thus changing themselves,
        families,even the fate of the country. When they have the opportunity
        to get out, it also means the progress of this region. However,
        knowledge may be the only way to change the existing situation to help
        them out of the difficulty. In a word, this website can give more
        children more opportunities to change themselves or help others have
        a more brilliant life. At same time the children will have more desire
        to learn and get out of poverty.
