        The ideal situation for the online school is that it functions as the
        regular school, which means it has the hierarchy and the basic structures.
        People who are going to manage the school should belong to the management
        department. Under the principal, they are also directors, advisors, and faculties.
      </br>
      </br>
        Letâ€™s talk about the management department first. The first thing is to
        have a principal to manage the whole team. The second thing is to divide
        the duties. Academic Department is going to take care all things about
        academic. Security Department is going to caring for the whole website.
        For example, the environment of the chatting room, whether it is a peace
        environment for children to communicate or not. The last part might be
        service department that might focus on arrange courses based on time,
        manage books or other donations, etc.
      </br>
      </br>
        The directors in online school are in charge of getting resources for
        classes. As said before, the courses are provided by volunteers or by
        donations from academic organizations. So, the duty of directors is to
        make sure that those courses meet the requirements. For example, whether
        the content of the course is appropriate? Whether the contents are taught
        clearly enough so the students could gain understanding? Another thing
        they need to do is to make sure those individual volunteers are qualified.
        The other standard character in school is advisors. They provide necessary
        information for students, answer most of the questions students have and
        help them plan their course. So, the advisors in the online school should
        be familiar with all the information about the school and have strong
        communication skills so they could communicate with people in different
        backgrounds. The most important role is the faculties. They are the people
        who directly to communicate with children. Even though it is an online
        school, their responsibilities should not be changed.

        The other possibilities are to have a department that made of parents.
        Those are the people who care about their children most. They have rights
        to give suggestions. In this way, parents are going to communicate with
        each other. (It is impossible to make every parent do that in a poor area,
        but it is possible to have representation in each area.)
      </br>
      </br>
        Ever single role that mentioned before is based on volunteers. It should
        not relate to money at all.
