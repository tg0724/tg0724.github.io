      <p class="p about">
        Generally speaking, when people mention the chat room, what will be in
        their mind is small chat. But in here, the most important and most basic
        function of chat room is to exchange information. This chat room can have
        the various countries, regions, and the children who learning through
        Internet platform connected together. We all know the meaning of the
        school is not only the acquisition of knowledge, but also the exchange
        and communication between peers. So for an online school, the chat room
        has played an important role in communication. In other words, on this
        platform, people who chat with you may share interesting things with
        you at any time. For example, children living in the desert told the
        children living by the sea that they have to go all day to fetch some
        water, or tell each other a different cultural customs and festivals.
        This function allows them to break the regional pattern of traditional
        school, so it is a good way to let them broaden their horizons.

          It is hard for me to build an actual chatroom online. The only thing that
          I can do is embed the code from the other chattign website. However,
          the safety are not guranteed. Althogh it does not ask users for personal
          information, but please do not use it for real chat. I put the chat room
          here to only to show that the functionality of it.
