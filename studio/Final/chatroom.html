        Generally speaking, when people mention the chat room, what will be in
        their mind is small chat. But in here, the most important and most basic
        function of chat room is to exchange information. This chat room can have
        the various countries, regions, and the children who learning through
        Internet platform connected together. We all know the meaning of the
        school is not only the acquisition of knowledge, but also the exchange
        and communication between peers. So for an online school, the chat room
        has played an important role in communication. In other words, on this
        platform, people who chat with you may share interesting things with
        you at any time. For example, children living in the desert told the
        children living by the sea that they have to go all day to fetch some
        water, or tell each other a different cultural customs and festivals.
        This function allows them to break the regional pattern of traditional
        school, so it is a good way to let them broaden their horizons.

    <div class="comment">For these kids, what we said about games may not be a concept. The traditional games are just designed to cheer up the mood. But the games we discussed now, they have more educational significance. How to let the children learn in the process of playing,for children in poor areas, especially in Africa, their school courses are  very irregular. Teachers are usually volunteers and often replaced. So the game learning is a good way to study by their own. For example, for some children whose nativeÂ language is not English, the first step is learning spelling of English letters and pronunciation. Different from the teachers who come from different school standing on the platform and teaching letters one by one, on the Internet,it may be a puzzle children game called "help the letter go home." When the computer makes a sound, the kids need to drag the subtitles to the appropriate place. Or when you click on the letter,it will pronounce a relevant pronunciation, or the letters could become other children' patterns. These games can be very good to help children acquire the knowledge and stimulate their interests.
