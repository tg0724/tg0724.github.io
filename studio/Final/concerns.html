        For such an idealized online school, there is a lot of difficulties and
        impossibilities, such as there is no network support in a really poor
        place. If it is possible to save online content to local file and
        regularly update. Or using satellite technology with other countries'
        support. While doing online school, I often think  which one is important
        between knowledge and skills. If it is more important to tell them how to
        build water pipes rather than tell them how to learn mathematics. Until one
        day, I suddenly understood  it is always better to teach a person who are
        hungry to fish than to give him some fish.Although skills are essential,
        what can change their difficulties still is their own and  knowledge
        they learned. Also if the online school can really be built up, which
        is not only for those children who can not go to school, but widely
        applied in society. If people study in online school and through some
        test they can  get the related degree,does this will change the
        educational patterns and forms that continued for thousands of years?
        This is also a question that worth thinking.

        And for building the online school, there are also some technique problem
        that need to be solved. For example, how to make the website looks like a
        school. (Not just appearence but also its functionalist.) For example, the
        homework system and how could teachers monitor student's work. Also, since
        the environment of those kids are specially, how could we make sure that students
        attend the courses continuousely? By taking attendence? Also, is there any
        way that the school get supported by government so students who finish the
        courses can get certification. That's all tough questions and that's why
        we need more people and more enery for founding the school.
