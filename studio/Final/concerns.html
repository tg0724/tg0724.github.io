        For such an idealized online school, there is a lot of difficulties and
        impossibilities, such as there is no network support in a really poor
        place. If it is possible to save online content to local file and
        regularly update. Or using satellite technology with other countries'
        support. While doing online school, I often think  which one is important
        between knowledge and skills. If it is more important to tell them how to
        build water pipes rather than tell them how to learn mathematics. Until one
        day, I suddenly understood  it is always better to teach a person who are
        hungry to fish than to give him some fish.Although skills are essential,
        what can change their difficulties still is their own and  knowledge
        they learned. Also if the online school can really be built up, which
        is not only for those children who can not go to school, but widely
        applied in society. If people study in online school and through some
        test they can  get the related degree,does this will change the
        educational patterns and forms that continued for thousands of years?
        This is also a question that worth thinking.

    <div class="comment">For these kids, what we said about games may not be a concept. The traditional games are just designed to cheer up the mood. But the games we discussed now, they have more educational significance. How to let the children learn in the process of playing,for children in poor areas, especially in Africa, their school courses are  very irregular. Teachers are usually volunteers and often replaced. So the game learning is a good way to study by their own. For example, for some children whose nativeÂ language is not English, the first step is learning spelling of English letters and pronunciation. Different from the teachers who come from different school standing on the platform and teaching letters one by one, on the Internet,it may be a puzzle children game called "help the letter go home." When the computer makes a sound, the kids need to drag the subtitles to the appropriate place. Or when you click on the letter,it will pronounce a relevant pronunciation, or the letters could become other children' patterns. These games can be very good to help children acquire the knowledge and stimulate their interests.
