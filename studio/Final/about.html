        The blogs are going to discuss about the accessibility of education for
        children. Basically, it will be an online course website for children who
        have trouble of physically being in classrooms. The online courses are
        open to everyone no matter which country they live and what's their
        financial background. The website is not just a place for taking course
        and getting education. It is more like a virtual school that children
        can communicate with each other. Since the courses are open to everyone,
        that means their classmates are come from different backgrounds, which is
        a great place for children to know what's going on on the other part of
        the world. That's the idea of online school. A free place for children
        get education and also make friends.

        Also, the the post will linked with Irene's as well so it is like an
        expanding reading. Here are some contents that will be focused on. The
        professional online courses, most of them are in commercial purpose and
        it is for adult. And then it is important to analyze what is the best
        way for children and what are the most appropriate way for children to
        accept and how to deliver the information efficiently as well as captivating.

        Since Irene and I are interesting in the similar topic. We are going
        to share the resources and media we found. It is a great way for us to
        know more about the background of those children. The posts are going to
        talk about the situation of the children that they living in and what are
        things need to be done. From my perspective, I will start searching from
        the facts first and then look more to secondary resources (documentary,
        videos, interviews). After we sharing those resources, we will share our
        opinions about the topic and somehow implement into our posts.
        </br>
        </br>
        At the end, we found we are doing slightly different with our original
        topics. Even though we are still doing topics that related to children,
        we are not in the exactly same direction. So, we decide to separate a bit
        but still share the resources and information.
