        In the case of ensuring the level of education, my goal is to improve
        the varieties of the courses as much as possible. The whole website site
        will focus on basic education, but  at the same time, I also hope to
        provide students with some interesting education. In my last blog, I
        mentioned that most of the courses are completed by volunteer teachers
        or donations from charities. So the courses' systematization and
        integration will be an important goal that need to be assessed.First
        there are two aspects will be explored and discussed. Basic education
        refers to the most basic education, such as basic mathematics, English
        and other subjects,which can be applied to our life. For poor countries,
        basic education should be limited to knowledge, also the technical
        training should be provided. Such as basic medical knowledge, emergency
        protection knowledge etc. In terms of interests, such as  music, dance,
        painting and other interests. These courses are designed to provide
        children with more interesting life and bring them more hope. However,
        what is  the most important is the basic education of necessary skills.
        Since the most courses are online resources and or provided by some
        volunteers, a course director in online school should assume the
        responsibility of course reviewing. So as to ensure that courses
        published online are qualified and fully beneficial to education.
        Also, how to update and continue the education is really important
        as well. Different countries have different situations, which means
        that different area might need different kinds of education. For example,
        the first goal for them is to recognize Chinese characters not English
        letters. So, how to make courses be various and fit for the different
        situations is difficult. In this case, the website is depends on
        volunteers in a world wide zone.
