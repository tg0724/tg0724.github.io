        For such a big project, it often can not be finished by one person, it always needs a lot of people’ help. The help in here is not the funds support, it means more resources, time and knowledge. What we really need are the course, the e-book and the time every volunteer paid. So in this project I personally hope there will be no a penny income involved in each step. Everyone is trying to get more and better resources to maximize the resources for those who are eager to go to school. So in here sincerely welcome every volunteer to come and join us. No matter which country you are, what job you engage in and how old you are. We have only one faith, that is to spread knowledge and let  knowledge  change the fate. At present we are working with a volunteer who has been stayed  in Haiti for long time and hoping to contribute our efforts to changing the poor life and education environment. If you are interested, welcome to contact with us.

    <div class="comment">For these kids, what we said about games may not be a concept. The traditional games are just designed to cheer up the mood. But the games we discussed now, they have more educational significance. How to let the children learn in the process of playing,for children in poor areas, especially in Africa, their school courses are  very irregular. Teachers are usually volunteers and often replaced. So the game learning is a good way to study by their own. For example, for some children whose native language is not English, the first step is learning spelling of English letters and pronunciation. Different from the teachers who come from different school standing on the platform and teaching letters one by one, on the Internet,it may be a puzzle children game called "help the letter go home." When the computer makes a sound, the kids need to drag the subtitles to the appropriate place. Or when you click on the letter,it will pronounce a relevant pronunciation, or the letters could become other children' patterns. These games can be very good to help children acquire the knowledge and stimulate their interests.
