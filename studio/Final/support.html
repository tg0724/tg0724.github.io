      <p class="p about">
        For such a big project, it often can not be finished by one person, it always needs a lot of people' help. The help in here is not the funds support, it means more resources, time and knowledge. What we really need are the course, the e-book and the time every volunteer paid. So in this project I personally hope there will be no a penny income involved in each step. Everyone is trying to get more and better resources to maximize the resources for those who are eager to go to school. So
        in here sincerely welcome every volunteer to come and join us. No matter which country you are, what job you engage in and how old you are. We have only one faith, that is to spread knowledge and let  knowledge  change the fate. At present we are working with a volunteer who has been stayed  in Haiti for long time and hoping to contribute our efforts to changing the poor life and education environment. If you are interested, welcome to contact with us.
