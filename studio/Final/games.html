        For these kids, what we said about games may not be a concept.
        The traditional games are just designed to cheer up the mood. But the
        games we discussed now, they have more educational significance. How to
        let the children learn in the process of playing,for children in poor
        areas, especially in Africa, their school courses are  very irregular.
        Teachers are usually volunteers and often replaced. So the game learning
        is a good way to study by their own. For example, for some children whose
        nativeÂ language is not English, the first step is learning spelling of
        English letters and pronunciation. Different from the teachers who come
        from different school standing on the platform and teaching letters one
        by one, on the Internet,it may be a puzzle children game called "help
        the letter go home." When the computer makes a sound, the kids need to
        drag the subtitles to the appropriate place. Or when you click on the
        letter,it will pronounce a relevant pronunciation, or the letters could
        become other children' patterns. These games can be very good to help
        children acquire the knowledge and stimulate their interests.
