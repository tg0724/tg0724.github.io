      <p class="p about">
        Based on the statistics, there are 30 million children are growing up
        in poverty, which means in low income community, there was only one book
        for every 300 children. In US, there are 25 states that had poverty
        rates for school-age children that lower than the national average. The
        lack of the education resources directly influenced the accessibility
        of basic education for the children. The worse thing is that the dropout
        rates of 16 to 24-years-old students who come from low income families
        are seven times more likely to drop out than those from families with
        higher incomes. All the data show the urgency of issue. The situation
        would not be change unless the environment of education gets better.
        It is hard to to get over the poverty in short time. But a child only
        have limited time for basic education in their life before they get
        shaped. So there is a way that might solve the problem. Living in a
        technology era, there are so many ways to get information from online.
        It is true that it is impossible to let 30 million attend schools
        physically but it is possible for them to attend the school online.
        The online school (different from online courses because it has a
        conception of community) provide all the information and the basic
        education course. These could be math, basic skills, literature, writing,
        etc. Unfortunately, for now, most online courses are in commercial side
        and most of them are for adults. However, the online school in its
        setting is only for children, who are hard to access the school
        resources. The online school has the conception of "online community",
        where students can talk about everything happened in their life, so
        they would not stay in their own world. Since it is a public school,
        no money should related to the project. Instead of trying to give
        every kid a book, it is more possible to donate a computer for a neighbor.
        All the courses are online and there also could be connections between
        each neighborhood, or across the states or even in  world scale. It is
        not a evil if children do not have book. The most terrible thing is
        that children cannot get the resources because where they born or
        who they are. Education should be fair to everyone and the ultimate
        goal is that everyone has the same right to access the education.
        The online school is a good start for children to get basic education
        and border their views through the virtue community.
