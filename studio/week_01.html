  <h2 style="font-family:Avenir; font-size:150%;text-align:center;" >Some Thoughts about User Experience</h2>
  <br>
  <div style="margin-right:150px;margin-left:150px">
  <p style="font-family:Avenir; font-size:100%;">
    User experience refers to people's emotions while they are
    using a particular system, service or product. In Marian Goldeen's case,
     she was learning how to use Smalltalk at Xerox, and she had a good
     experience. The reason why she felt good or enjoyed this system
     because the system has very clear step by step instructions that
     make people can follow easily, such as how to start machines up.
     In my opinion, a good user experience can be judged by these three
     aspects: on-boarded instructions, extendability, and the capability.
  </p>
  <p style="font-family:Avenir; font-size:100%;">
    On-boarded plays a significant role in user experience because
    it gives the user the first impression of the whole system. The
    system might be super complicated, but the on-boarded should always be
    clear and detailed so users can get it at the first time. It is always
    good for users to explore the system but before they start to explore,
    an instruction of how to use the system in basic level should be given.
    In this example, the on-boarded part is how to set up the machine,
    how to draw the basic shapes and rotate or transform it. After Marian
    had known how to do this, she explored the system by herself and created
    her own too, which showed the extendability of the system.
  </p>
  <p style="font-family:Avenir; font-size:100%;">
    The extendability of the system is the other perspective that
    I want to talk about. Extendability means that people can do something
    by using the system or product not limited in the basic level.
    In Smalltalk specifically, the primary tool is just to draw shapes
    and transform them. However, users can convert those shapes as brushes
    to paint, which is more interesting. So, a successful system should
    enable users to explore the things more, maybe customized something,
    to make people enjoy using the system.
  </p>
  <p style="font-family:Avenir; font-size:100%;">
    The last thing is capability. What extent can the system or the software
    meet people's requirement? It will be boring if Smalltalk can only draw
    one square and not enable people to move it around. At the same time,
    how easy to do it? Is it easy as just drag and move or is it complicate
    as users have to enter the long order to control it? That's all belong to
    the capability of the system.
  </p>
  <p style="font-family:Avenir; font-size:100%;">
    The Smalltalk just an early example to show users' role in the technology era. Even now, in the digital age, users are still the most important because all the system invented are trying to make people live easily. Thus, the user experience should always be put in the first place when we design a system, software or product and trying simplified complicated stuff for users should always be the goal.
